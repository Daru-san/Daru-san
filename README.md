- Kon'nichiwa, watashinonamaeha Darudesu
- You can call me Daru-san
## Who is Daru-san?
- Self-proclaimed Linux philosopher and digital privacy advocate
- I'm not really here to do anything serious, just some fun projects and repos I play around with, nothing much
- If you have any advice for me I'd love to hear it, my goal is to learn as much as I can as long as I can so every lesson counts!
- My main focus goes to Linux and Android, modding is my thing, so I'd love to see some custom mods from others, can't wait to see yours!

## December TODO list:
- [ ] Create an anime client for Linux, _so I can watch more One Piece_
- [ ] Make my Linux desktop 10/10, _like it's not already_
- [ ] FOSS-ify everything, _and I mean *everything*_

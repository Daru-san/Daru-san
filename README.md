- Self-proclaimed Linux philosopher and digital privacy advocate
- I'm not really here to do anything serious, just some fun projects and repos I play around with, nothing much
- If you have any advice for me I'd love to hear it, my goal is to learn as much as I can as long as I can so every lesson counts!
